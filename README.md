# Source code for 3D bat reconstruction pipeline
  Here is the repo contains all the source code for our work "A Model-Based Deep-Learning Approach to Reconstructing the Highly Articulated Flight Kinematics of Bats". There are three major conponents, soft rasterization, LBS model, and Blender post-processing. 
## Soft rasterization
  Our pipeline is based on Soft rasterization and need to be setup using: https://github.com/ShichenLiu/SoftRas
## LBS model
  
## Blender template design / post-processing
1. Blender_script: Contains three script for template design and export, kinematic import, and reconstruction visualization with camera array position
2.
